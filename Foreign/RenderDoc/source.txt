RenderDoc is available from https://renderdoc.org/ -- please check it out.
The renderdoc_app.h is part of the distribution available there; it describes the interface for the shared library that is part of the capture tool itself
I'm using the license described on the top of the header file itself (ie, the MIT license) to include it in this distribution
